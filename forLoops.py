print('My name is')
for i in range(5):
    print("Jimmy Five Times" + str(i))


    #in the range function 1 parametr will go from i to the parameter.  If there are 2 aeguments the loop will start at the first argument and go to the second argument but not invludr it in theout out. If there are 3 arguments, it starts at the first argument, goes to the second arguments, and the third argument is how much the loop iterates.  if the 3rd arguments is 2 the loop iterates by 2.  Same goes for negative numbers/
