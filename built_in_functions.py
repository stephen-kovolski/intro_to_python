#import modules with import statements

import random

#random.randint(1, 10)

print(random.randint(1, 10)
)


import random, sys, os, math
#import multiple module by using commas.

from random import *
#the dot means all, so this line is importin all from random.  This allows us to not have to use random.  to use the functions like above.  It would look like this,

print(randint(1, 10))

#its better to use the fist example becayse we can alwasy find wher the randint function lives.  That would be random in this case.  






#sys.exit() will cancel a program early if you want/need it to stop at a certain point

import sys

print('hello')
sys.exit()
print('goodbye')




#There are also 3rd party programs kind of like npm.  the pip progam is like npm.
